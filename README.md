# Integrating Kubernetes Batch Scheduling Systems for Containerized Declarative Data Analyses

The project aims to evaluate the seamless integration and performance of the Kueue batch scheduling system within the REANA platform, a robust open-source solution designed for reproducible and declarative data analysis in containerized computing clouds. As the REANA platform facilitates streamlined workflows for researchers in the field of High-Energy Physics (HEP), the project focus relies on testing the viability of Kueue within the context of runtime user jobs, laying the groundwork for future developments that may introduce FAIR share capabilities within the REANA ecosystem.

## About

[REANA](http://www.reana.io) is a reusable and reproducible research data analysis
platform. It helps researchers to structure their input data, analysis code,
containerised environments and computational workflows so that the analysis can be
instantiated and run on remote compute clouds.

REANA was born to target the use case of particle physics analyses, but is applicable to
any scientific discipline. The system paves the way towards reusing and reinterpreting
preserved data analyses even several years after the original publication.

## Features

- structure research data analysis in reusable manner
- instantiate computational workflows on remote clouds
- rerun analyses with modified input data, parameters or code
- support for several compute clouds (Kubernetes/OpenStack)
- support for several workflow specifications (CWL, Serial, Yadage, Snakemake)
- support for several shared storage systems (Ceph)
- support for several container technologies (Docker)

## Getting started

You can
[install REANA locally](https://docs.reana.io/administration/deployment/deploying-locally/),
[deploy it at scale on premises](https://docs.reana.io/administration/deployment/deploying-at-scale/)
(in about 10 minutes) or use <https://reana.cern.ch>. Once the system is ready, you can
follow the guide to run
[your first example](https://docs.reana.io/getting-started/first-example/). For more in
depth information visit the [official REANA documentation](https://docs.reana.io/).
